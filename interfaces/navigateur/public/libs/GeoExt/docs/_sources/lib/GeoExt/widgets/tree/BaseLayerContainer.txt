.. class:: BaseLayerContainer

   A layer container that will collect all base layers of an OpenLayers
   map. Only layers that have displayInLayerSwitcher set to true will be
   included. The childrens' iconCls defaults to
   "gx-tree-baselayer-icon" and this node' text defaults to
   "Base Layer".

   Children will be rendered with a radio button instead of a checkbox,
   showing the user that only one base layer can be active at a time.

   To use this node type in ``TreePanel`` config, set nodeType to
   "gx_baselayercontainer".
