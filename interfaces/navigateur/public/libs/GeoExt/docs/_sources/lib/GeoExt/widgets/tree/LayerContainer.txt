.. class:: LayerContainer

    A subclass of ``Ext.tree.AsyncTreeNode`` that will collect all layers of an
    OpenLayers map. Only layers that have displayInLayerSwitcher set to true
    will be included. The childrens' iconCls defaults to
    "gx-tree-layer-icon" and this node' text defaults to "Layers".

    Note: if this container is loaded by an ``Ext.tree.TreeLoader``, the
    ``applyLoader`` config option of that loader needs to be set to
    "false". Also note that the list of available uiProviders will be
    taken from the ownerTree if this container's loader is configured
    without one.

    To use this node type in ``TreePanel`` config, set nodeType to
    "gx_layercontainer".
