    ``gx_treenodeactions``



A plugin to create tree node UIs with actions.

An action is a clickable image in a tree node, which, when clicked,
leads to an "action" event being triggered by the node.

To set actions in a node an ``actions`` property must be provided in
the node config options. This property  is an array of
action objects, each action object has the following property:

* "action" ``String`` the name of the action. It is used as
  the name of the ``<img>`` class. The ``img`` tag being placed in a
  div whose class is "gx-tree-layer-actions" a CSS selector for the
  action is ``.gx-tree-layer-actions .action-name``. The name of the
  action is also provided in the "action" event for listeners to know
  which action got clicked. (required)
* "qtip" ``String`` the tooltip displayed when the action
  image is hovered. (required)
* "update" ``Function`` a function executed after the action is
  rendered in the node, it receives the ``Ext.Element`` object
  representing the image and executes with the node as its
  scope. For example, this function can be used to hide the
  action based on some condition. (optional)



Example Use
-----------

Sample code to create a layer node UI with an actions plugin:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var uiClass = GeoExt.examples.LayerNodeUI = Ext.extend(
       GeoExt.tree.LayerNodeUI,
       new GeoExt.tree.TreeNodeUIEventMixin()
    );

    // this function takes action based on the "action"
    // parameter, it is used as a listener to layer
    // nodes' "action" events
    function onAction(node, action, evt) {
        var layer = node.layer;
        switch(action) {
        case "delete":
            layer.destroy();
            break;
        }
    };

    var tree = new Ext.tree.TreePanel({
        region: "west",
        width: 250,
        title: "Layer Tree",
        loader: {
            applyLoader: false,
            uiProviders: {
                "ui": GeoExt.examples.LayerNodeUI
            }
        },
        // apply the tree node actions plugin to layer nodes
        plugins: [{
            ptype: "gx_treenodeactions",
            listeners: {
                action: onAction
            }
        }],
        root: {
            nodeType: "gx_layercontainer",
            loader: {
                baseAttrs: {
                    radioGroup: "radiogroup",
                    uiProvider: "ui",
                    actions: [{
                        action: "delete",
                        qtip: "delete"
