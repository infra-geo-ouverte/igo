.. class:: PrintMapPanel

A map panel that controls scale and center of a print page. Based on the
current view (i.e. layers and extent) of a source map, this panel will be
sized according to the aspect ratio of the print page. As the user zooms
and pans in the :class:`GeoExt.PrintMapPanel`, the print page will update
its scale and center accordingly. If the scale on the print page changes
(e.g. by setting it using a combo box with a
:class:`GeoExt.plugins.PrintPageField`), the extent of the
:class:`GeoExt.PrintMapPanel` will be updated to match the page bounds.

.. note:: The ``zoom``, ``center`` and ``extent`` config options will have
    no affect, as they will be determined by the ``sourceMap``.



Example Use
-----------

A map with a "Print..." button. If clicked, a dialog containing a
PrintMapPanel will open, with a "Create PDF" button.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var mapPanel = new GeoExt.MapPanel({
        renderTo: "map",
        layers: [new OpenLayers.Layer.WMS("Tasmania State Boundaries",
            "http://demo.opengeo.org/geoserver/wms",
            {layers: "topp:tasmania_state_boundaries"}, {singleTile: true})],
        center: [146.56, -41.56],
        zoom: 6,
        bbar: [{
            text: "Print...",
            handler: function() {
                var printDialog = new Ext.Window({
                    autoHeight: true,
                    width: 350,
                    items: [new GeoExt.PrintMapPanel({
                        sourceMap: mapPanel,
                        printProvider: {
                            capabilities: printCapabilities
                        }
                    })],
                    bbar: [{
                        text: "Create PDF",
                        handler: function() {
                            printDialog.items.get(0).print();
                        }
                    }]
                });
                printDialog.show();
            }
        }]
    });

    


Config Options
--------------

Configuration properties in addition to
those listed for `Ext.Panel <http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.Panel>`_.


.. describe:: center

    ``OpenLayers.LonLat`` or ``Array(Number)``  A location for the map
    center. Do not set, as this will be overridden with the ``sourceMap``
    center.

.. describe:: extent

    ``OpenLayers.Bounds or Array(Number)``  An initial extent for the map.
    Do not set, because the initial extent will be determined by the
    ``sourceMap``.

.. describe:: layers

    ``GeoExt.data.LayerStore or GeoExt.data.GroupingStore or Array(OpenLayers.Layer)``
    A store holding records. The layers provided here will be added to this
    MapPanel's map when it is rendered.

.. describe:: limitScales

    ``Boolean`` If set to true, the printPage cannot be set to scales that
    would generate a preview in this :class:`GeoExt.PrintMapPanel` with a
    completely different extent than the one that would appear on the
    printed map. Default is false.

.. describe:: map

    ``Object`` Optional configuration for the ``OpenLayers.Map`` object
    that this PrintMapPanel creates. Useful e.g. to configure a map with a
    custom set of controls, or to add a ``preaddlayer`` listener for
    filtering out layer types that cannot be printed.

.. describe:: prettyStateKeys

    ``Boolean`` Set this to true if you want pretty strings in the MapPanel's
    state keys. More specifically, layer.name instead of layer.id will be used
    in the state keys if this option is set to true. But in that case you have
    to make sure you don't have two layers with the same name. Defaults to
    false.

.. describe:: printProvider

    :class:`GeoExt.data.PrintProvider` or ``Object`` PrintProvider to use
    for printing. If an ``Object`` is provided, a new PrintProvider will
    be created and configured with the object.
    
    .. note:: The PrintMapPanel requires the printProvider's capabilities
      to be available upon initialization. This means that a PrintMapPanel
      configured with an ``Object`` as ``printProvider`` will only work
      when ``capabilities`` is provided in the printProvider's
      configuration object. If ``printProvider`` is provided as an instance
      of :class:`GeoExt.data.PrintProvider`, the capabilities must be
      loaded before PrintMapPanel initialization.

.. describe:: sourceMap

    :class:`GeoExt.MapPanel` or ``OpenLayers.Map`` The map that is to be
    printed.

.. describe:: zoom

    ``Number``  An initial zoom level for the map. Do not set, because the
    initial extent will be determined by the ``sourceMap``.




Public Properties

.. attribute:: PrintMapPanel.previewScales

    ``Ext.data.Store`` A data store with a subset of the printProvider's
    scales. By default, this contains all the scales of the printProvider.
    If ``limitScales`` is set to true, it will only contain print scales
    that can properly be previewed with this :class:`GeoExt.PrintMapPanel`.

.. attribute:: PrintMapPanel.printPage

    Read-only.
