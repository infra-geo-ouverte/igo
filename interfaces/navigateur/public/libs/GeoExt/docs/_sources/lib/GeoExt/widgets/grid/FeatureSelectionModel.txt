.. class:: FeatureSelectionModel

    A row selection model which enables automatic selection of features
    in the map when rows are selected in the grid and vice-versa.



Example Use
-----------

Sample code to create a feature grid with a feature selection model:

.. code-block:: javascript

     var gridPanel = new Ext.grid.GridPanel({
        title: "Feature Grid",
        region: "east",
        store: store,
        width: 320,
        columns: [{
            header: "Name",
            width: 200,
            dataIndex: "name"
        }, {
            header: "Elevation",
            width: 100,
            dataIndex: "elevation"
        }],
        sm: new GeoExt.grid.FeatureSelectionModel()
    });

    


Config Options
--------------

Configuration properties in addition to
those listed for `Ext.grid.RowSelectionModel <http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.grid.RowSelectionModel>`_.


.. describe:: autoActivateControl

    ``Boolean`` If true the select feature control is activated and
    deactivated when binding and unbinding. Defaults to true.

.. describe:: autoPanMapOnSelection

    ``Boolean`` If true the map will recenter on feature selection
    so that the selected features are visible. Defaults to false.

.. describe:: layer

    ``OpenLayers.Layer.Vector`` The vector layer used for the creation of
    the select feature control, it must already be added to the map. If not
    provided, the layer bound to the grid's store, if any, will be used.

.. describe:: layerFromStore

    ``Boolean`` If true, and if the constructor is passed neither a
    layer nor a select feature control, a select feature control is
    created using the layer found in the grid's store. Set it to
    false if you want to manually bind the selection model to a
    layer. Defaults to true.

.. describe:: selectControl

    ``OpenLayers.Control.SelectFeature`` A select feature control. If not
    provided one will be created.  If provided any "layer" config option
    will be ignored, and its "multiple" option will be used to configure
    the selectionModel.  If an ``Object`` is provided here, it will be
    passed as config to the SelectFeature constructor, and the "layer"
    config option will be used for the layer.

.. method:: FeatureSelectionModel.bind

    :param obj: ``OpenLayers.Layer.Vector`` or
        ``OpenLayers.Control.SelectFeature`` The object this selection model
        should be bound to, either a vector layer or a select feature
        control.

        geometries
    
    Calculates the max extent which includes all selected features.

.. method:: FeatureSelectionModel.unbind

    :return: ``OpenLayers.Control.SelectFeature`` The select feature
