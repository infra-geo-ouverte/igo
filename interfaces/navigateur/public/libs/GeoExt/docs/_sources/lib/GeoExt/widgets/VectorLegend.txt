Config Options
--------------

Configuration properties in addition to
those listed for `Ext.Container <http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/docs/?class=Ext.Container>`_.


.. describe:: bodyBorder

    ``Boolean``
    Show a border around the legend panel. Default is ``false``.

.. describe:: clickableSymbol

    ``Boolean``
    Set cursor style to "pointer" for symbolizers.  Register for
    the ``symbolclick`` event to handle clicks.  Note that click events
    are fired regardless of this value.  If ``false``, no cursor style will
    be set.  Default is ``false``.

.. describe:: clickableTitle

    ``Boolean``
    Set cursor style to "pointer" for rule titles.  Register for
    the ``titleclick`` event to handle clicks.  Note that click events
    are fired regardless of this value.  If ``false``, no cursor style will
    be set.  Default is ``false``.

.. describe:: enableDD

    ``Boolean``
    Allow drag and drop of rules. Default is ``false``.

.. describe:: labelCls

    ``String``
    Optional css class to use for the layer title labels.

.. describe:: layer

    ``OpenLayers.Layer.Vector``
    The layer that this legend will be based on.  One of ``layer``,
    ``rules``, or ``layerRecord`` must be specified in the config.

.. describe:: layerRecord

    :class:`GeoExt.data.LayerRecord`
    The record containing a vector layer that this legend will be based on.
    One of ``layerRecord``, ``layer``,  or ``rules`` must be specified in
    the config.

.. describe:: legendTitle

    ``String``
    Optional title to be displayed instead of the layer title.  If this is
    set, the value of ``showTitle`` will be ignored (assumed to be true).

.. describe:: rules

    ``Array(OpenLayers.Rule)``
     List of rules.  One of ``rules``, ``layer``, or ``layerRecord`` must be
     specified in the config.  The ``symbolType`` property must also be
     provided if only ``rules`` are given in the config.

.. describe:: selectOnClick

    ``Boolean``
    Set to true if a rule should be selected by clicking on the
    symbol or title. Selection will trigger the ruleselected event, and
    a click on a selected rule will unselect it and trigger the
    ``ruleunselected`` event. Default is ``false``.

.. describe:: showTitle

    ``Boolean``
    Whether or not to show the title of a layer. This can be overridden
    on the LayerStore record using the hideTitle property.

.. describe:: symbolType

    ``String``
    The symbol type for legend swatches.  Must be one of ``"Point"``,
    ``"Line"``, or ``"Polygon"``.  If not provided, the ``layer`` or
    ``layerRecord`` config property must be specified, and the geometry type
    of the first feature found on the layer will be used. If a rule does
    not have a symbolizer for ``symbolType``, we look at the symbolizers
    for the rule, and see if it has a ``"Point"``, ``"Line"`` or
    ``"Polygon"`` symbolizer, which we use for rendering a swatch of the
    respective geometry type.

.. describe:: untitledPrefix

    ``String``
    The prefix to use as a title for rules with no title or
    name.  Default is ``"Untitled "``.  Prefix will be appended with a
    number that corresponds to the index of the rule (1 for first rule).
